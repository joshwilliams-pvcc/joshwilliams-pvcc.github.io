<h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>

<h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Programming structures:</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
    <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):</li>
        <li>while loop: continue as long something is true</li>
        <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
        <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
    
</ul>
    <dl>
    
        Recursive structures:
        <dt>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</dt>
        <dt>Repitition continues until:</dt>
            <dd>degeneraative case, which is a termination condition, is met</dd>
            <dd>(degenerative case is also called a "base case")</dd>
    </dl>
<h2>Two classic programming/database problems</h2>
        <h4>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</h4>
           <li> Sorting numbers </li>
        <li>Sorting strings (in accordinance with ASCII values)</li>
        <h4>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</h4>
            <br>In database:
               <li> Filters: temporary searching</li>
            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
        <h4>Two popular search techniques:</h4>
            <dt>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</dt>
            <dt>Binary search:</dt>
                <dd>only works if data is SORTED first</dd>
                <dd>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</dd>
<h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
        Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources
        Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions

<h3>Software testing and verification</h3>
    Kinds of tests:
(find the definitions for these here: https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-testing)
    <ol>
        <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</li>
        <li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together</li>
        <li>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application</li>
        <li>Functional testing:Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements</li>
        <li>Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads</li>
        <li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality</li>
        <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails</li>
        <li>Usability testing:Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Software testing is done to detect:</h4>
    <ul>       
        <li>Arctitectural flaws</li>
        <li>Poor design decisions</li> 
        <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
        <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Scalability issues</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>Testing best practices:</h4>
    (explain these--see the IBM web site for the information)
    <ul>
        <li>Continuous testing: Project teams test each build as it becomes available</li>
        <li>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test</li>
        <li>Service virtualization: simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner</li>
        <li>Defect or "bug tracking": Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality</li>
        <li>Metrics and reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results</li>
    </ul>
